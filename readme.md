####Bugs I know of-
* __CodeMirror__ isn't working properly, i.e, everytime we select a new language in `admin.php`, a new _textarea_ is appended above the previous one instead of replacing the one we have to refresh the page, or ignore the textareas except the _top-most_ one.
* User is able to edit the values of `No. of Questions` and `Total Time` by editing the HTML of the page.
  * and as the `%age` is being stored in the __database__ and not the `marks`, user can set `No. of Questions` to 1 and if he's correct, can get 100% marks.
* Login system for admin isn't working properly.
