* Add videos in the __videos__ folder and link them in lines `138,139` in _index.php_.
* Everything is in `$_GET` to better understand things. It needs to be changed to `$_POST` for better security.
* Add first __admin__ directly in the table(_admins_) for security.

####Bugs I know of-
* __CodeMirror__ isn't working properly, i.e, everytime we select a new language in `admin.php`, a new _textarea_ is appended above the previous one instead of replacing the one we have to refresh the page, or ignore the textareas except the _top-most_ one.
* User is able to edit the values of `No. of Questions` and `Total Time` by editing the HTML of the page.
